The plugin adds support of BEMHTML markup language to IDEA.

It is a restored version of outdated existing [BEM Support plugin](https://github.com/afelix/bemidea-bemhtml) with some minor fixes and improvements.

## Why not fork?

Seems like author abandoned development of his plugin. Also it was necessary to reassemble project from scratch due a lack of `.iml` file for further debugging right in IDEA.

## Building

You need to have installed PhpStorm, its path used in `bemhtml-support.iml` file. Probably you will need to adjust this path, because I'm using OS X. Also you need to build it with PhpStorm SDK configured with JDK 1.6.

Very likely it is possible to build the plugin with WebStorm as well I'm just not tried that.
